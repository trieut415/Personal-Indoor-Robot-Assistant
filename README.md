## 4. Summary
The quest involves designing and building a personal indoor robot assistant capable of navigating through predefined waypoints while avoiding obstacles. We use the ESP32 we have been using the whole semester with an indoor positioning system (Optitrack) for lcoating the robot. The robot kart also uses a sharp-IR sensor for obstacle detection. We use a NodeJS application to process positional data and overlook the communication between multiple robots connected over the same WiFi network. The ultimate goal was to encorporate autonomous navigation, real-time obstacle avoidance, as well as a multimodal option that would allow users to use WASD keyboard inputs. Finally, this project requires a graphic display of robots and waypoints in 2D via tingoDB and streamlit.

### Desired Behaviors

1. **Autonomous Navigation**
   - Navigate through a set of predefined waypoints using positional data from Optitrack.
   - Implement feedback control (PID) to keep our robot on a path within +/- 10cm.

2. **Obstacle Avoidance**
   -  Use sharp-IR sensors to detect and avoid collisions real-time. 
   - Implement priority-based sensor processing to ensure that the robot avoids collisions over staying on the path. 

3. **Coordinator Communication**
   - Use a NodeJS server to receive real-time coordinates (x, z, theta) from Optitrack.
   - Handle more than one simultaneous robots on the same network without problems.

4. **Remote Control (WASD) Mode**
   - Allow users to switch modes between 'automatic' and 'manual' modes, making the robot able to be controlled using WASD inputs on our NodeJS server. 

5. **Real-Time Monitoring and Visualization**
   - Create a graphical display of the robots' positions and waypoints on a laptop using Streamlit.
   - Store positional data in TingoDB for real-time updates 

### Solution Requirements

1. **Hardware Integration**
   - The ESP32 microcontroller serves as the central component, interfacing with IR transmitters and receivers, sharp-IR sensors, and GPIO peripherals (buttons, LEDs).
   - The robot requires precise integration with the Optitrack indoor positioning system for accurate navigation and real-time location updates.
   - Network hardware supports WiFi connectivity for communication between multiple robots and the NodeJS server.
   - Robust and low-latency obstacle detection is achieved through sharp-IR sensors.

2. **Network Communication**
   -  Use of UDP for message passing ensures minimal overhead, supporting real-time communication between all interfaces, TingoDB, Node.js, and streamlit. 
   -  The NodeJS server handles simultaneous robot connections on a shared WiFi network, receiving and processing location data and commands.
   -  Real-time updates to the database (TingoDB) ensure consistent monitoring of robots' status.

3. **Control Systems**
   -  Feedback control (PID) is implemented to maintain the robot's position within a +/- 10cm margin from predefined waypoints.
   -  Priority-based processing ensures obstacle avoidance takes precedence over maintaining path alignment during autonomous navigation.

4. **Software Components**
   - Visualization and control are achieved through a Streamlit-based interface for graphical representation of robot positions and waypoints.

5. **Concurrency and Synchonization**
   - Mutexes and semaphores prevent race conditions and ensure synchronized access to shared resources such as network sockets and the database.
   - FreeRTOS tasks ensure concurrent handling of operations, IR message transmission/reception, UDP communication.

## 6. Summary

**Potential Improvements**
- **Hardware Interrupts**: Use hardware interrupts for Sharp-IR sensor readings to enhance real-time performance and reduce CPU load compared to polling-based detection.

**Results**
The project successfully developed a personal indoor robot assistant capable of navigating through predefined waypoints and avoiding obstacles in real time. Using positional data from the Optitrack system and Sharp-IR sensors for obstacle detection, the robot autonomously navigates or can be manually controlled via WASD inputs. The NodeJS server facilitates real-time communication and data management, while Streamlit provides a graphical interface for monitoring robot status and waypoints. TingoDB ensures data persistence for positional tracking and historical analysis.

**Challenges**
- **Real-Time Communication**: Maintaining seamless UDP communication with multiple robots on the same WiFi network required significant effort to handle packet collisions and data loss.
